# Technical Specification: VernisAI Chrome Extension

## Overview

VernisAI Chrome Extension is a browser-based tool that enables users to generate context-aware replies from selected text on social media platforms, starting with X.com (Twitter). The extension offers different personality options for the AI-generated responses, representing Monsoft Solutions (company), VernisAI (product), or a personal voice.

## Architecture

### Extension Components

1. **Manifest (manifest.json)**

   - Configuration file defining extension properties, permissions, and resources
   - Specifies content scripts, popup resources, and required permissions

2. **Content Scripts (contentScript.js)**

   - Runs in the context of web pages
   - Captures selected text from the web page
   - Communicates with popup and background script using Chrome message passing
   - Injects generated content into the page's reply field

3. **Popup Interface (popup.html, popup.js, popup.css)**

   - User-facing interface displayed when extension icon is clicked
   - Displays selected text
   - Provides personality selection options
   - Shows generated reply with copy/use options

4. **Background Script (background.js)**
   - Manages extension lifecycle
   - Handles communication between content scripts and popup
   - Orchestrates API requests for content generation

### MVP Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI for accessible, customizable components
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons for consistent, lightweight iconography
- **Extension Framework**: Chrome Extension API
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (for MVP)
