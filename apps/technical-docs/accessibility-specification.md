- Semantic element usage over generic divs

#### Interactive Elements

- Native HTML elements used where possible
- Custom elements with appropriate ARIA roles
- Event handlers on appropriate elements
- No device-dependent event handlers

### CSS Implementation

#### Presentation Separation

- Separation of content and presentation
- No CSS that would interfere with assistive technology
- Graceful degradation without CSS
- No absolute positioning that breaks zoom functionality

#### Responsive Design

- Fluid layouts that adapt to zoom levels
- Text containers that expand with increased text size
- Media queries for different viewport sizes
- No horizontal scrolling at 400% zoom

### JavaScript Implementation

#### Progressive Enhancement

- Core functionality available without JavaScript
- Enhanced experience with JavaScript enabled
- Fallbacks for failed script execution
- No reliance on mouse-specific events

#### ARIA Dynamic Updates

- Appropriate use of aria-live regions
- Status messages announced to screen readers
- Focus management during dynamic content changes

- Regression testing for accessibility features
- Automated reporting of accessibility violations
- Blocking of PRs that reduce accessibility

### Manual Testing

#### Screen Reader Testing

- NVDA on Windows
- VoiceOver on macOS
- TalkBack on Android (for future mobile versions)
- Testing common user flows with screen readers only

#### Keyboard Testing
